Ronald Weasley is depicted as a loyal, brave, strong, and humorous individual, yet sometimes immature and insensitive. His wisecracking humor often lightened the mood for his friends, although it could unintentionally hurt at times. Ron's maturity grew during the search for Voldemort's Horcruxes, where he even led the trio through Harry's depressive phases. Ron's character was shaped by a sense of overshadowing by his brothers and a feeling of being second-best, particularly next to his famous friend, Harry. This led to jealousy and insecurity, fueling his argumentative nature, especially with Hermione. Their frequent bickering, though not malicious, often masked deeper feelings for each other. Inherited from the Weasley family, Ron had a strong temper, notably provoked by Snape's spitefulness and Malfoy's bigotry. He consistently defended his friends and family, particularly against Muggle-born prejudice, and showed exceptional bravery in protecting them, even confronting his fear of spiders to support Harry. Ron's sensitivity about his family's poverty was a significant aspect of his youth, often leading to embarrassment and insecurity. His possessions, mostly hand-me-downs, and his family's financial status made him a target for Draco Malfoy's taunts. This contributed to his feeling overshadowed and his noticeable physical reaction of reddening ears when embarrassed or angry. Passionate about Quidditch and a decent player, Ron struggled with nerves affecting his performance. His deepest fears, revealed by Slytherin's Locket, included being least loved by his mother and Hermione's preference for Harry over him. His childhood fear of spiders stemmed from a prank by his brother Fred. Ron's perspective often reflected typical wizarding views, clashing with Harry and Hermione's Muggle-raised viewpoints. His reactions to Lupin's lycanthropy, Hagrid's half-giant heritage, and the treatment of goblins illustrated this. Yet, he showed deep appreciation for Dobby's sacrifice, helping bury him and being visibly moved at his grave. Ron had a notable love for food, often eating with his mouth full, to Hermione's distaste. He particularly enjoyed bacon sandwiches but disliked corned beef. His love of food continued into adulthood, leading to a portly middle age. Intelligent but lazy, Ron depended heavily on Hermione's help in school, often struggling when she was unavailable. Ron frequently used swear words, notably in instances involving Snape, Malfoy, and during the Battle of Hogwarts. His bravery was comparable to Harry's, fearlessly facing danger alongside his friends and willing to sacrifice himself for them. Despite his fierce temper, Ron often maintained a level head in stressful situations. His pragmatic approach was evident in his views on house-elf treatment and his reaction to Dumbledore's past with Grindelwald. However, this pragmatism sometimes made him appear na√Øve and insensitive. Ron preferred taking the easy route, often evident in his academic efforts, like making up Divination homework or copying from Hermione. However, he could set aside this tendency when necessary, as shown by his efforts to help Hagrid with Buckbeak's case. Ron was fiercely protective, particularly of his sister Ginny, which sometimes led to heated exchanges between them. His protective nature was a hallmark of his deep care for those close to him.
